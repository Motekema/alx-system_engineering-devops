## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** February 17, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 17, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The web application took an unexpected siesta, leaving approximately 60% of users scratching their heads instead of browsing. It seems our servers decided to play hide and seek, causing slow response times and intermittent errors for our beloved users.
- **Root Cause:** Like a rebellious teenager, our load balancer decided to throw a tantrum and misconfigure itself, resulting in a traffic jam where some servers were partying hard while others were left twiddling their thumbs.

## Timeline:
- **10:00 AM:** The issue sprang to life like a caffeinated squirrel, triggering monitoring alerts faster than you can say "404 error."
- **10:10 AM:** Our valiant engineers sprang into action, diving headfirst into the murky depths of our application infrastructure.
- **11:00 AM:** After chasing a few red herrings and dodging a couple of wild geese, attention finally turned to the load balancer, the mischievous culprit.
- **12:30 PM:** Like a detective in a cheesy crime drama, we followed misleading clues down dead-end alleys, including checking for ghostly DDoS attacks and gremlins in the network.
- **1:00 PM:** Faced with the stubborn load balancer, we called in the cavalry – the DevOps team – for some much-needed backup.
- **2:00 PM:** Victory was ours! With the load balancer's misconfiguration tamed, traffic flowed smoothly once more through the servers, and the web application sprung back to life like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** The load balancer's misconfiguration was akin to a traffic cop on vacation, letting cars pile up in one lane while leaving others deserted.
- **Resolution:** With a swift adjustment to the load balancer's settings, traffic was once again distributed evenly among the servers, bringing harmony to our digital highway.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Introduce automated monitoring to keep a watchful eye on the load balancer's behavior, ensuring it behaves like a well-trained puppy.
  - Conduct regular audits of our infrastructure to catch any misbehaving components before they throw another tantrum.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update our playbook with load balancer configuration best practices, ensuring a smoother ride in the future.
  - Organize a team-wide training session on load balancer management, turning our engineers into load-balancing ninjas ready to tackle any challenge.
